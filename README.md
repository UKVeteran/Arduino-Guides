<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>This repository provides LaTeX-based templates and professionally compiled PDF guides for Arduino projects. These guides are designed to help you document your projects with clear, structured sections that include wiring diagrams, component lists, and step-by-step instructions. The PDF files are ready to use and serve as both templates and complete guides for your Arduino-based projects.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use the templates and guides in this repository, you will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A LaTeX editor like Overleaf or a local LaTeX installation (for customization).</li>
    <li>An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, etc.).</li>
    <li>Basic knowledge of LaTeX for document compilation (if you wish to modify the templates).</li>
    <li>Basic electronic components such as LEDs, resistors, sensors, and wires for hands-on experimentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
